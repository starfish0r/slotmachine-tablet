# slotmachine-tablet
This is an android app displaying a slot machine. The plan is to connect to a Lego NXT brick via bluetooth.
The brick sends a signal to the app, starting the slot machine game. In case of a won game, the app sends a signal back to the brick.
The two devices send heartbeats to each other since I have no experience with bluetooth. The NXT freezes up a lot, so testing is horrible.

The files for the NXT are in the nxjfiles branch.
